						<p>Brew Guides from Intelligentsia are the coffee industry's answer to B2B whitepapers. Lovely
							photography precedes step-by-step instructions for a variety of coffee-making tools. Learn how to
							brew the perfect cup of coffee in a French press, Chemex, V60, and beyond. It's free information
							that reminds you why Intelligentsia is such a lauded coffee master (we marketers might even say a
							coffee "thought leader")... and the content makes you want a cup of their coffee ASAP.

							Birchbox is a popular purveyor of monthly beauty boxes. The brand also runs an excellent content
							marketing program, with how-to videos of useful beauty tricks (for example, getting beach waves
							for short hair and how to look great post-flying). They're essentially running a full-scale beauty
							magazine without the mess of paper and addresses.

							Custom motorcycle and surfboard outlet Deus Ex Machina consistently creates content that goes
							beyond selling. It delivers a culture. In the brand's own words, "Deus ex Machina is a step bigger
							than a brand: it’s a culture. Our openness and enthusiasm strike a chord with people, wherever
							they are... Deus ('day-us') didn’t set out only to sell custom parts and hand- built motorcycles,
							but to celebrate a culture of creativity."
						</p>
						<p>
							In the brand's latest short film I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night, the film crew follows surfers
							catching waves and living the dream in a beautiful landscape. The chill, vibey video doesn't try
							to sell you surfboards or even mention Deus's product lines, but simply reinforces the lifestyle
							that Deus is all about. To watch the full film, viewers must enter an email address, which is a
							smart way to deliver high-quality content at a negligible cost to the viewer.

							Anthropologie frequently features DIY cocktail recipes on their blog, like this one for a coconut
							cooler. The drink recipes work for two main reasons: they're seasonal and timely (for example, summer
							refreshers or winter warmers) and they feature unique ingredients and flavors, mimicking the original
							style of Anthropologie's fashions. Like many examples of the best content marketing, these posts aren't
							an obvious play for sales; Anthropologie doesn't sell homemade bitters or simple syrup. Instead, the
							posts position Anthropologie as a trendy, knowledgeable friend who knows a thing or two about drinks—as
							well as clothes.

							It's a simple concept, but Wistia executes to perfection: short, educational videos that teach
							viewers how to be better video marketers. Each short lesson is a microcosm of some concept within
							video marketing, including bulleted lists for easier retention of the subject matter. I can think
							of very few brands that couldn't create a video series like this for their products or services,
							with minimal resources invested. Check out this example video on concepting fundamentals.

							Businesses of any size can learn something from the OPEN Forum posts by American Express. Posts
							center around leadership, customer service, marketing, and technology, and they position American
							Express as a true partner to business owners. Take a look at these examples of currently trending
							posts on the website, and get a glimpse of the free, valuable ideas being shared by the credit
							card company.
